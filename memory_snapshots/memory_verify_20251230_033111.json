      "comment": "**Original Motivation:** The cyclic group $C_n$ has $\\rho(C_n)=1/n$. By inverse Galois theory for abelian groups, $C_n$ is realizable as a Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Construct $f$ with Galois group $C_n$ (e.g., using subfields of cyclotomic fields). Then $d(f)=1/n$, so $d(E_f)=1-1/n$. The conjecture that this is maximal follows from the belief that no transitive group of degree $n$ has $\\rho(G) < 1/n$.\n\n**Proof History & Accumulated Experience:**\nMultiple proof attempts were made, all following the same core strategy: (1) Relate $d(E_f)$ to $d(f)$ via complementarity, (2) Prove the universal lower bound $d(f) \\ge 1/n$ using Burnside's lemma and Chebotarev, (3) Construct an explicit polynomial with Galois group $C_n$ to show attainability.\n\n**Key Obstacles & Insights from Failures:**\n1.  **Precise Density Relationship:** The equality $d(E_f) = 1 - d(f)$ requires careful handling of ramified primes. The correct justification is that $S_f$ and $E_f$ partition the unramified primes (a set of density 1), so the densities are complementary (lem_017). This must be stated clearly to avoid logical gaps.\n2.  **Deriving the Lower Bound:** The most common error was a flawed application of Burnside's lemma to derive $d(f) \\ge 1/n$. The correct argument uses the upper bound $|\\operatorname{Fix}(g)| \\le n$ for $g \\in H$ (elements with fixed points). From Burnside: $|G| = \\sum_{g\\in H} |\\operatorname{Fix}(g)| \\le n\\cdot|H|$, hence $|H| \\ge |G|/n$ and $\\rho(G) \\ge 1/n$. Several attempts incorrectly used lower bounds on $|\\operatorname{Fix}(g)|$ or manipulated inequalities in the wrong direction, leading to invalid conclusions.\n3.  **Constructive Existence:** Proving attainability requires: (a) Realizability of $C_n$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (via Kronecker-Weber: for any $n$, choose prime $m \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$; the unique subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$ of degree $n$ is cyclic). (b) Ensuring the constructed polynomial's Galois group acts *regularly* on its roots. This follows because in a Galois extension of degree $n$ with cyclic group, the action on the roots of a primitive element's minimal polynomial is simply transitive (stabilizers are trivial). This point was often assumed without explicit justification.\n4.  **Quantifier Precision:** Statements like \"any polynomial with regular Galois action achieves $d(f)=1/n$\" are true, but the converse (only such polynomials achieve it) is not necessarily true. The existence proof only requires one example, not a classification.\n\n**Suggested New Exploration Directions (Inspired by Attempts):**\nWhile the conjecture is now proven (see lem_019 and lem_031), the attempts highlight related open problems and refinements:\n1.  **Characterization of Minimizers:** Which polynomials (beyond those with regular Galois action) achieve $d(f)=1/n$? Study the fiber $\\Phi_n^{-1}(1/n)$ of Galois groups with $\\rho(G)=1/n$. Are there non-regular groups with this property? This refines the inverse problem for minimal density.\n2.  **Explicit Minimal Discriminant:** Among polynomials of degree $n$ with $d(f)=1/n$, what is the minimal possible discriminant? For $n=6$, the cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_9(x)=x^6+x^3+1$ gives $d(f)=1/6$. Is its discriminant minimal? This connects to the object $\\Delta_{\\min}(n, r)$ (obj_031).\n3.  **Statistical Rarity:** How rare are polynomials with $d(f)=1/n$ among those with bounded coefficients? Study the asymptotic growth of $N_n(1/n; H)$ (obj_032) as $H \\to \\infty$. This quantifies the \"size\" of the minimal density fiber in parameter space.\n4.  **Abelian Exceptional Set Structure:** For a polynomial $f$ with $d(f)=1/n$ (cyclic Galois group), the exceptional set $E_f$ has density $1-1/n$ and is described by congruence conditions (lem_014). Investigate the minimal modulus $N_f^{\\text{ab}}$ (obj_044) for such polynomials. How does it relate to the conductor and discriminant?\n\n**Conclusion for Subsequent Workers:**\nConjecture conj_008 is settled. The proof is a straightforward application of Burnside's lemma (for the lower bound) and classical inverse Galois theory for cyclic groups (for attainability). Future work should not attempt to reprove this result but can build upon it, exploring the characterization, explicitness, and statistics of minimal-density polynomials as outlined above. The failed attempts serve as a reminder to handle Burnside's lemma inequalities with care and to fully justify the regularity of the Galois action in constructive proofs.",

The goal was to derive a contradiction with the non-abelian hypothesis.\n\n**Key Obstacles & Insights from Failures:**\n1.  **Structural Control of \\(C_{\\text{der}}\\):** The main difficulty was correctly and rigorously deducing the structure of \\(C_{\\text{der}}\\) from the congruence assumption. The successful argument (lem_030) shows that congruence description forces the characteristic function of \\(E_f\\) to factor through the abelianization of \\(G\\), implying \\(C_{\\text{der}}\\) is a union of fibers of the map to \\(G^{\\text{ab}}\\). This is a cleaner, more direct approach than the attempts, which often got entangled in flawed arguments about the action of \\([G,G]\\) on the roots.\n2.  **Pitfall: Action of the Commutator Subgroup:** Several attempts incorrectly tried to use the condition \"every element of \\([G,G]\\) fixes a root\" to force \\([G,G]\\) to act trivially, via flawed invariance or orbit arguments. The lesson is that this condition alone is insufficient; one must use the stronger structural fact that \\(C_{\\text{der}}\\) is a union of cosets of \\([G,G]\\), which isolates \\([G,G]\\) from \\(C_{\\text{der}}\\) entirely.\n3.  **Technical Precision:** Common errors included imprecise handling of ramified primes, misstatements about the surjectivity of restriction maps, and incorrect applications of Chebotarev (e.g., confusing elements with conjugacy classes). The final proof requires careful attention to these technicalities.\n4.  **Simpler Path:** The attempts revealed that a successful proof avoids intricate analysis of the permutation action of \\([G,G]\\). Instead, it leverages the functoriality of the Artin map and the fact that periodicity modulo \\(N\\) corresponds to factoring through the cyclotomic field \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_N)\\), which is abelian.\n\n**Suggested New Exploration Directions (Inspired by Attempts):**\nWhile the conjecture is proven, the attempts highlight related open problems:\n1.  **Quantitative Non-Congruence:** For a non-abelian \\(G\\), how can one quantify the failure of \\(E_f\\) to be congruential? For example, study the minimal modulus \\(N\\) for which a positive proportion of primes in \\(E_f\\) obey a congruence condition, or analyze the Fourier coefficients of the indicator function of \\(E_f\\).\n2.  **Approximate Congruences:** Could \\(E_f\\) be approximated (in density) by a finite union of arithmetic progressions?

This connects to Dirichlet's theorem for non-abelian extensions and the theory of Artin L-functions.\n3.  **Algorithmic Recognition:** Given a polynomial \\(f\\) (e.g., by its coefficients), can one algorithmically decide if \\(E_f\\) is congruential without fully computing the Galois group? This is a refinement of the inverse Galois problem.\n\n**Conclusion for Subsequent Workers:**\nConjecture conj_009 is settled.
